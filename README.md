Dim Sum Collector
Fun spin on the Crystals Collector game, which seemed bland.


Instructions:
Chen Shifu gives you money to spend at Ding Tai Fung and is insistent that you spend every penny of it!

Use the money to order dim sum from the (quite limited) menu. When you order the food (click the picture), your bill will add up in the bottom right.

Order the most food you can without going over the amount Chen Shifu gave you. Spend every penny to win!

If you can't pay the bill, they call the cops and arrest you lol.

Watch out, Ding Tai Fung is having issues with their shrimp and pork suppliers, causing their prices to change after every time you eat there. They also lost their menus, so you won't know the price of each item until you order it.
